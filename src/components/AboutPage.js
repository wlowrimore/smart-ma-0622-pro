        <h1>What Is This All About?</h1>
        <p>
          As a musician who struggles with retaining too many catchy
          progressions that seep into my own compositions, I began researching
          to find a tool that would help me write my own melodies without the
          interference of these subconsciously harboured hits and jingles. When
          I came up empty I decided to create this tool myself. I present to you
          "Melody Architect!"
        </p>
        <p>
          As in all aspects of creative expression, we musicians hit that
          "wall", and just can't seem to find our way over it. We write these
          incredible lyrics that we hope will touch and inspire the listener who
          is, has, or will be experiencing our same emotions. Timeless...poetry
          in limbo. How do we write a melody that will capture those emotions,
          and give them a deeper meaning?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where "Melody Architect" comes in. This ground-breaking app is
          designed with the forementioned struggle in mind. No one wants to cry
          about their troubles and sorrows to an upbeat "party like it's 1999"
          (type of) melodic movement. On the same note, nobody wants to "cry me
          a river" when they just got exciting news. You get the picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          With "Melody Architect" your lyrics are translated into chord
          structures based on key words associated with feelings. You are then
          presented with these randomly generated structures. All you have to do
          is arrange the chords in a way that works best for you. You can even
          transpose your finished masterpiece to any key signature if you would
          like.
        </p>
        <p>So, with that said...Let's go write a hit!</p>
